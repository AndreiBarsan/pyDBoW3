# pyORBSLAM2
Ultra-fast Boost.Python interface for [ORBSLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2)

Use run.sh to run nvidia-docker environment to build build/ORBSLAM2.so, which you should then put on your PYTHONPATH.
See test/test.py for an example. Extend orbslam2.cpp to your needs (comes with NumPy/cv::Mat conversion routines, and already includes Boost::Python::NumPy set up for you should you need it)

I have no time right now to write an extended documentation, but please contact me at cs@robots.ox.ac.uk any time and I will assist you.

You can use this repo as a basis for any other Boost.Python projects as well.

# Get started

# Ubuntu 

Clone this repository (or even better: fork it!)

`git clone git@github.com:torrvision/pyORBSLAM2.git`

Install nvidia-docker plugin: see https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker
Note: You require nvidia-docker plugin on host, as Pangolin2 requires OpenGL support

Now run the nvidia-docker container:

`sudo ./run.sh`

(It will take a while to compile OpenCV3)
(SSH password: source)

Now, inside the container SSH shell, simply do:
(ensure build and bin folders are deleted to force CMake to update properly)

`/orbslam/src/build.sh`

`export PYTHONPATH=/orbslam/src/build:$PYTHONPATH`

Now you should be able to try the test example inside the container:

`python3 /orbslam/src/test/test.py`

(press key for GUI windows to open)

The above is for Python3 only, if you require Python2.x support or have any other questions / issues, please contact me:

All the best
